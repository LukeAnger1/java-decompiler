# java-decompiler
This will decompile a jar file into class files and java files while preserving packages

# This is just meant to be a quick way to decompile jar files

# There are two main commands

# command 1: This command will decompile the jar file into packages and classes

# command 2: This commmand will go through the folder and its subfolders and change the class files into java files


# TODO: currently I only have use of keeping all the java files in the same location as class files, may consider changing to have option to put the java files into new project
